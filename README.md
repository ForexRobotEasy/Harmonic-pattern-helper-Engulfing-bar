Introduction:
Harmonic Pattern Helper Engulfing Bar is an expert advisor designed to detect and trade harmonic patterns in the forex market. It specifically focuses on identifying engulfing bar patterns and using them as a signal for potential trades. This expert advisor is developed by Forex Robot Easy Team and can be used as a tool to optimize forex trades.

Product Description:
Harmonic Pattern Helper Engulfing Bar is a powerful tool for forex trading that can help traders identify potential trading opportunities based on engulfing bar patterns. Engulfing bar patterns occur when a bullish or bearish candle completely engulfs the previous candle, indicating a potential reversal in the market.

This expert advisor is equipped with the ability to detect engulfing bar patterns and further analyze them to identify specific harmonic patterns such as Gartley, Bat, and Butterfly. These harmonic patterns are known for their high probability of success and can provide valuable trading signals.

The expert advisor allows users to customize their trading parameters, including lot size, stop loss, take profit, maximum spread, slippage, and a unique magic number for trade identification. Users can set their desired risk levels and trading preferences to suit their individual trading strategies.

Harmonic Pattern Helper Engulfing Bar aims to optimize forex trades by executing trades within a pre-defined price range. It opens buy trades when the engulfing bar pattern is detected, with the option to set stop loss and take profit levels based on the entry price. The expert advisor also checks if the current spread is within the allowed range before executing the trade.
